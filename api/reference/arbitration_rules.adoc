[[creating-arbitration-rules]]
=== Creating Arbitration Rules

Arbitration Rules can be created via a POST to the arbitration rules collection
or via the *create* action signature which allows creation of multiple
arbitration rules in a single request.

As an example:
[source,json]
----
{
  "operation"   : "inject",
  "expression"  : {
    "EQUAL" : {
      "field" : "User-userid",
      "value" : "admin"
    }
  },
  "arbitration_profile_id": 101
}
----

= Operations
The following are the allowed values for the _operation_ field:
`inject`, `disable_engine`, `auto_reject`, `require_approval`, `auto_approve`

[NOTE]
=====
if the operation is `inject`, an `arbitration_profile_id` is required.
=====

= Expression
The passed _expression_ field is stored as a serialized MiqExpression and requires
the following format:
[source,json]
----
{
  "<Operator>": {
    "field" : "<ObjectType>-<ObjectAttribute>",
    "value" : "<ValueOfAttribute>"
  }
}
----

The _operator_ allows the following:
`EQUAL`, `=`, `!=`, `like`, `not like`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

The following example would create a rule to check wither a User object's attribute `userid` is equal to `admin`
[source,json]
----
{
  "expression" : {
    "EQUAL" : {
      "field" : "User-userid",
      "value" : "admin"
    }
  }
}
----

=== Editing Arbitration Rules
The API allows for editing one:
----
POST /api/arbitration_rules/:id
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "edit",
  "resource" : {
    "description": "Updated Arbitration Rule description"
  }
}
----

or editing multiple arbitration rules:

----
POST /api/arbitration_rules
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action": "edit",
  "resources" : [
    {
      "href": "http://localhost:3000/api/arbitration_rules/101",
      "description": "a new description"
    },
    {
      "href": "http://localhost:3000/api/arbitration_rules/201",
      "description": "a new description"
    }
  ]
}
----

[[deleting-arbitration-rules]]
=== Deleting Arbitration Rules

Arbitration Rules can be deleted via the *delete* _POST_ action or via the _DELETE HTTP_ method.

----
POST /api/arbitration_rules/101
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action": "delete
}
----

or

----

  ]
